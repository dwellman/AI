# Artificial Intelligence in a Human World
- https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence%20%20in%20a%20Human%20World.pdf
  
# Theoretical Frameworks:

- Move 37: On the shift from truth to reward-seeking behavior.
- https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/papers/move-37.md
  
- The Dark Triad: Emergent behavioral risks in self-reinforcing models.
- https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/papers/dark-triad.md

- Artificial Empathy: Operationalizing ethics through system constraints.
- https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/papers/artificial-empathy.md

# Implementations (GitHub):

- VAWK: Demo of Grounding and Verification for coding. 
- https://github.com/dwellman/vawk

- BUUI Adventure: Demo of state-anchored orchestration and game-engine verification.
- https://github.com/dwellman/adventure
