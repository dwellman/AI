# Artificial Intelligence in a Human World
- [Artificial Intelligence in a Human World](https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence%20%20in%20a%20Human%20World.pdf)
  
# Theoretical Frameworks:

- [Move 37](https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/papers/move-37.md): On the shift from truth to reward-seeking behavior.
  
- [The Dark Triad](https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/papers/dark-triad.md): Emergent behavioral risks in self-reinforcing models.

- [Artificial Empathy](https://github.com/dwellman/AI/blob/main/papers/artificial-empathy.md): Operationalizing ethics through system constraints.

# Implementations (GitHub):

- [VAWK](https://github.com/dwellman/vawk): Demo of Grounding and Verification for coding. 

- [BUUI Adventure](https://github.com/dwellman/adventure): Demo of state-anchored orchestration and game-engine verification.
