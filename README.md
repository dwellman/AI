# Artificial Intelligence in a Human World
- [Artificial Intelligence in a Human World](github.com)
  
# Theoretical Frameworks:

- [Move 37](github.com): On the shift from truth to reward-seeking behavior.
  
- [The Dark Triad](github.com): Emergent behavioral risks in self-reinforcing models.

- [Artificial Empathy](github.com): Operationalizing ethics through system constraints.

# Implementations (GitHub):

- [VAWK](github.com): Demo of Grounding and Verification for coding. 

- [BUUI Adventure](github.com): Demo of state-anchored orchestration and game-engine verification.
