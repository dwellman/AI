# Theoretical Frameworks:

- Move 37: On the shift from truth to reward-seeking behavior.
- The Dark Triad: Emergent behavioral risks in self-reinforcing models.
- Artificial Empathy: Operationalizing ethics through system constraints.

# Implementations (GitHub):

- VAWK: Demo of Grounding and Verification for coding. 
- https://github.com/dwellman/vawk

- BUUI Adventure: Demo of state-anchored orchestration and game-engine verification.
